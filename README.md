# Rust training

This repository contains material used for an internal Rust training at W3C.

Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) can be viewed directly in github,
or opened interactively in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).


## Dependencies

These notebooks require [evcxr_jupyter](https://github.com/google/evcxr/blob/master/evcxr_jupyter/README.md)
(Rust kernel Rust for Jupyter).

I also use [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) to display them in slide mode,
which only works with old Jupyter notebooks (`nbclassic`).
